# dango-generator-v1
This project is a modification of this [repo](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-examples-p5.js/tree/master/chp09_ga/NOC_9_04_Faces_interactiveselection), a example from the book Nature of Code that implements a simple Genetic Algorithm and uses p5.js. 
What's new includes a set of assets that make up the population, day-night logic to survival that interacts with the dango's body color and more. 

* But, what is Dangos?
The inspiration for this came by the characters of an anime that Nagisa (from Clannad) watches!
